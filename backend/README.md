Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller

In this milestone, I focused on enhancing the app by implementing essential features related to user management and file uploads.

What Was Achieved

User Model:
Designed and created a User Model using Mongoose. This model serves as the blueprint for user data, including fields like name, email, and password.
The User Schema defines the structure of user data stored in the MongoDB database.
User Controller:
Implemented a User Controller that handles different user-related operations such as creating a new user, getting user information, and updating user details.
The controller ensures that user data is processed correctly by the server and responds to client requests accordingly.
File Uploads with Multer:
Integrated Multer to enable file uploads in the app. This allows users to upload files such as profile pictures.
Configured Multer to handle file storage, naming, and limiting file sizes, ensuring a smooth file upload process.
