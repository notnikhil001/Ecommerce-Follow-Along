## Milestone 2: **Project Setup & Login Page** 🎯

### ✅ **What we achieved in Milestone 2:**

1. **📂 Project Folder Structure:**

   - Essential tools and packages like **React**, **React Scripts**, and **Tailwind CSS** have been configured for seamless development. 🖥️

3. **💻 Node.js Backend Setup:**
   - A simple **Node.js server** was set up to handle the backend logic and future API integrations. 🌐
   - This prepares us for upcoming milestones where we'll dive deeper into backend functionality.

4. **🎨 Tailwind CSS Configuration:**
   - We integrated **Tailwind CSS** for easy, utility-first styling, ensuring our app looks modern and responsive. 💅

5. **🔐 Login Page Development:**
